This project is my personal website built using React and Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, and deployed on Vercel. It includes an overview of my professional journey, project showcases, and details on the technologies I use. The website also features user-friendly navigation, dark mode functionality, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. It is designed to load quickly and provide a seamless user experience.
